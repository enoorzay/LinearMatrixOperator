This program will (eventually) be able to perform all the primary operations learned in UCSD's Math 20F course, Linear Algebra. It is slowly gaining functionality, and can currently reduce a matrix to reduced echelon form and check for consistency, invert a matrix (if its invertible), find a matrices determinant, and do matrix multiplication.

USAGE:
The program has prompts when run, initially bringing up a menu where an input of '1' allows declaration of a matrix, '2' brings up a menu for matrix operations, and '3' searches for a matrix by its name.

RECENT ADDITIONS:
-Storage of multiple matrices at once, so that any can be called for a certain operation.
- Quality of life changes like remembering last matrix altered and offering to use that initially for the next operation.
- Converting between augmented and nonaugmented matrices.
-Determinant calculation.

NEXT ON LIST TO ADD
-Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
-Diagonalization
-Stability
-Clean up code, some functions and variables are never used.
